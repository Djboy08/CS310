1). In my experience of writing these programs I was using ‘Visual Studio Code’ with a linux subsystem on Windows. 
This allows me to test my code properly on a linux environment using the sub-system as well as use VS Code as my text editor. 
I ran my programs a few times on the cs.umb.edu server to ensure that my code was at least running. 
My overall experience programming these was pretty easy and straightforward. 
I did not have really any issues other than getting the autograder to grade my work properly.

3).
Compiling the java files: 

justi@DESKTOP-FGHTBTM MINGW64 /f/Downloads/CS310/src (master)
$ javac -d ../classes pa0/*.java


Changing Directory and running the program:
justi@DESKTOP-FGHTBTM MINGW64 /f/Downloads/CS310/src (master)
$ cd ../classes
